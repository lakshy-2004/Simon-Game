# Simon-Game
The Simon Game project is a memory-based game where players must repeat a sequence of colored lights and sounds. The game starts with a simple pattern, and each time the player correctly repeats it, the pattern gets longer. The goal is to remember and repeat the sequence without making mistakes, testing both memory and concentration skills.
